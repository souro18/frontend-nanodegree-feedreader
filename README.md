# Frontend-Nanodegree-Feedreader

This is a web based project which is build as a part of Udacity's [Front-End Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) Program. This project primarily focuses on testing framework Jasmine. Jasmine helps us to test our website automatically using programs. Given a website which loads feed dynamically using ajax, the Jasmine based test file tests the app for various conditions.
